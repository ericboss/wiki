# Wiki
Designing a Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia using Django & HTML.
## Description
CS50â€™s [Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/) Project 1 - [Wiki](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/1/wiki)

## Project description
In practice, it would start to get tedious if every page on Wikipedia had to be written in HTML. 

Instead, it can be helpful to store encyclopedia entries using a lighter-weight human-friendly markup language. 

Wikipedia happens to use a markup language called Wikitext, but for this project to store encyclopedia entries I've used the very popular markup language called Markdown.

Each encyclopedia entry will be saved as a Markdown file inside of the entries/ directory. While rendering each page, it is then converted into HTML.
